# 2D convolution application

This project was a school project commissioned by Vincent Claes for the class "Hardware accelerated computing" from the pxl. The goal is to write two application. A classic C application and a cuda accelerated program that does 2D convolution on images.

Eventually the program will be analyzed using tools like nvccprof and gprof to measure performance and identify the speed increase.

## Folder structure

There are two folders:

`cuda` contains the hardware accelerated code

`C` contains the regular code

## How to run

## Our results
